## Poster Abstract

This poster introduces the **PDC Ladder for Teacher Education**, a visual and conceptual model that distinguishes digital competence at three interconnected levels: pupils, teachers, and teacher educators. Based on Starkey’s model for teachers’ Professional Digital Competence and extended through Uerz et al.’s emphasis on modeling and metacommunication, the framework supports a clearer understanding of the complex role teacher educators play in preparing future teachers for the digital age.
