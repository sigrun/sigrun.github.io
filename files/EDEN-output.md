# 👣 What Teacher Educators Can Do

Make digital competence visible. Think aloud. Invite reflection.  
Show the ‘why’ behind the ‘how’.

---

## 🎙️ Comment on your own tool choices while teaching

> “I’m using Padlet to surface all your contributions — but I’ve turned off anonymous posting. In schools, anonymity can lead to distractions or even misuse.”

---

## ❓ Ask metacognitive questions

> “What would pupils learn differently if *they* made the graph — instead of watching *us* do it?”

> “What did this tool *allow* you to do — and what did it *prevent*?”

---

## 🧾 Share your planning and decision-making process

> “I chose this simulation instead of a video because it lets you explore how one variable changes the outcome.”

> “I used video feedback here to show tone and nuance — something harder to express in text.”

---

## 📽️ Model your own digital practices

- Record how you evaluate digital tools  
- Share your reasoning for sequencing tasks  
- Demonstrate how you troubleshoot or adapt in real time

---

## 📝 Build reflection into assignments

> “Along with your lesson plan, include 200 words on how you modeled inquiry-based learning using digital tools.”

> “Explain why you chose this platform, and what it communicates to pupils about learning.”

---

## ⚖️ Make dilemmas visible

> “We’re using a cloud-based quiz — but what if the Wi-Fi fails? What’s your plan B?”

> “AI tools are useful — but how do we balance efficiency with ethical concerns like student data privacy?”

> “Let’s consider: What data do we ask pupils to share? Who sees it, and how is it stored?”

---

## 💬 Use your own practice as a case for analysis

> “Let’s analyse this teaching clip — not to find mistakes, but to unpack the reasoning behind my decisions.”

> “Here’s what I might do differently next time, and why.”
